# GRAR Address Match Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document describes the refactoring of the GRAR address matching code to improve its architecture while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Introduced Domain Abstractions**
- `AdresMatchRequest`: Encapsulates the input for address matching
- `AdresMatchResult`: Hierarchy of result types that know how to convert themselves to events
- `IAdresMatchStrategy`: Strategy pattern for determining the best match

### 2. **Separated Concerns**
- **Domain Layer** (`/Domain`): Contains pure business logic and interfaces
- **Application Layer** (`/Application`): Orchestrates the address matching workflow
- **Infrastructure Layer** (`/Infrastructure`): Implements external dependencies (GRAR client interactions)

### 3. **Dependency Injection**
- Replaced static method with instance-based service
- All dependencies are now injected, making the code testable
- Services can be registered in DI container for production use

### 4. **Single Responsibility**
- Address matching logic separated from event creation
- Gemeente enrichment extracted to its own service
- Each class now has a single, well-defined purpose

### 5. **Backward Compatibility**
- Original `AdresMatchService` preserved as an adapter
- Existing code continues to work without modification
- Migration can be done gradually

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Testability**: Each component can be tested in isolation
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations (e.g., different matching strategies)
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes changes easier
4. **Domain-Driven**: Business logic is expressed in domain terms
5. **SOLID Principles**: Adheres to Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, and Dependency Inversion

## Migration Path

For teams wanting to adopt the new structure:

1. Register services in DI container:
```csharp
services.AddScoped<IAdresMatchStrategy, PerfectScoreMatchStrategy>();
services.AddScoped<IAdresVerrijkingService, GemeenteVerrijkingService>();
services.AddScoped<IAdresMatchService, AdresMatchServiceRefactored>();
```

2. Inject `IAdresMatchService` instead of using static method
3. Remove calls to static `AdresMatchService.GetAdresMatchEvent()`

The refactoring maintains all existing behavior while providing a cleaner, more maintainable architecture aligned with clean architecture and DDD principles.
